# MadLib Madness

A website where you can pick from madlib outlines by a topic and then you will fill in the word prompts with your own and have the story shown to you with your inputed words instead of the prompts. There is also a User MadLib gallery to see all of the other MAdLibs people created and saved into the gallery.

- It will have a database with all of the outlines in one table that will be queried from and sent to the front end

- There will be GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request functions for getting the madlib outline, for sending the words from the user, and for deleting words and changing the words sent in.

- Possible apis will be used for extra fun on website as well. Not sure yet.
